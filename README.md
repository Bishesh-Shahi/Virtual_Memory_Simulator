# Virtual_Memory_Simulator
 # Virtual Memory Simulator  ## Project Description The Virtual Memory Simulator is a Java-based educational tool that demonstrates the concepts of virtual memory management in operating systems. It provides a graphical user interface to simulate how virtual memory works with multiple processes, including page tables, Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), and page faults.  ## Features - Multi-process virtual memory simulation - Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) implementation - Page table management - Real-time statistics tracking - Process status monitoring - Interactive step-by-step execution - Continuous simulation mode with pause/resume capability  ## Technical Specifications - Built using Java Swing for the GUI - Concurrent process simulation using ExecutorService - Thread-safe operations with synchronization - Real-time statistics updates - Color-coded process status indicators  ## Getting Started  ### Prerequisites - Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher - Java Runtime Environment (JRE)  ### Installation 1.
