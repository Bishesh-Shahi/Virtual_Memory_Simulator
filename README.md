### Usage Instructions
1. Configure the simulation parameters:
   - Number of Pages: Total virtual memory pages
   - Number of Frames: Physical memory frames available
   - TLB Size: Size of the Translation Lookaside Buffer
   - Number of Processes: Concurrent processes to simulate (1-10)

2. Click "Initialize" to start the simulation

3. Choose your execution mode:
   - "Step": Execute one memory access at a time
   - "Run All": Continuously run the simulation
   - "Pause/Resume": Control continuous execution

### Statistics Tracked
- Total page references
- TLB miss ratio
- Page fault ratio
- Per-process statistics
- Process status (Running, Sleeping, Paused, Finished)
